"""
Traffic Light Detector ROS node for Carla.

Uses tensorflow to run semantic segmentation model (FCN).
The model finds bounding boxes for potential traffic lights in the image.
Then classifier is called to classify what kind of light is it.
The waypoint index of the next traffic light (within range) is published to /traffic_waypoint.
If next traffic light is out of range or in-range but not RED then -1 is published.

Implementation uses separate thread to run detector/tensorflow code because it is resource
intensive and interferes with message dispatch for ROS if run in the same thread.
